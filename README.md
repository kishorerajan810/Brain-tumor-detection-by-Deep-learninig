# Brain-tumor-detection-by-Deep-learninig
#Overview and Objectives
   The main purpose of this project was to build a CNN model that would classify if subject has a tumor or not base on MRI scan. I used the VGG-16 model architecture and weights to train the model for this binary problem. I used accuracy as a metric to justify the model performance which can be defined as:
   Accuracy=[(Number of correclty predicted images)/(Total number of tested images)]Ã—100%

Final results look as follows:
   Set 	Accuracy
   Validation Set = ~88%
   Test Set = ~80%
   Validation set - is the set used during the model training to adjust the hyperparameters.
   Test set - is the small set that I don't touch for the whole training process at all. It's been used for final model performance evaluation.
   NO - no tumor, encoded as 0
   YES - tumor, encoded as 1

#What is brain tumor and symptoms?
   Brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. Other symptoms may include difficulty walking, speaking or with sensations. As the disease progresses, unconsciousness may occur.


#ABSTRACT
   Brain tumor is one of the most aggressive diseases among children and adults in the world . Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.
Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and TransferLearning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.
